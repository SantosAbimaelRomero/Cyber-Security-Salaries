**Top 10 Salaries Analysis**

From 2020 to 2022 we see a sudden shift in desire from someone who can organize the cyber security workers in a business in 2020 to someone who is capable to respond at a high level of expertise to either prevent, or quickly respond to, security issues. 

2023 and beyond: For anyone seeking to make the highest salary possible in the cyber security field will most likely need to focus more on field expertise rather than the business/governance side of cyber security as the need to either prevent or quickly and accurately respond will only increase as IoT and other technologies begin to control more and more aspects of company and personal life based on the data presented here.
