### 2020: The highest paying job was during this year was "Security Engineering Manager" with a ~$600k a year salary.

Security Engineering Manager: Initiates the conceptual design, technical specifications and oversees implementation of all new security systems/projects.

After this job there is a large drop to ~450k as an ethical hacker and then the rest of the jobs are between 200k to 300K. There is a very large difference between the highest paying job and most other jobs in the field.

### 2021: The highest paying job for this year was a "Staff Security Engineer" at ~$450k a year.

Security Engineer, or Security Administrator: handles the digital security for their company or clients.

Not sure what happened to the salaries for security engineering managers if it simply was not accounted for this year or something happened to the position this year.

### 2022: The highest paying job for this year was between "Detection Engineer" that reached about ~$900k dollars.

Detection engineering: is the process of identifying threats before they can do significant damage.

### Overall Analysis

From 2020 to 2022 we see a sudden shift in desire from someone who can organize the cyber security workers in a business in 2020 to someone who is capable to respond at a high level of expertise to either prevent, or quickly respond to, security issues.

2023 and beyond: For anyone seeking to make the highest salary possible in the cyber security field will most likely need to focus more on field expertise rather than the business/governance side of cyber security as the need to either prevent or quickly and accurately respond will only increase as IoT and other technologies begin to control more and more aspects of company and personal life based on the data presented here.

### Overall Analysis
These are interesting numbers to see because these jobs within the US pay much more than was recorded when the data was collected. For greater understanding of these numbers I will cross reference location of company and residence of employee in the following visuals. Allowing me to better understand how these jobs that pay much more in the US have entries where the salary is less than $10k.

## Lowest Salaries by Company Location per Year

### Overall Analysis
From 2020 to 2022 we see an increase in the number of countries with companies offering very low wages for cyber security. This is most likely due to greater modernization allowing for more countries access to technology.

From 2020 to 2022, some countries increased their wages while others stayed the same for their lowest payed in the cyber security field.

Looking at the exact countries that are paying these low wages, it is not unreasonable to consider that these are their yearly salaries as for these graphs I am using the USD equivalent ("salary_in_usd column") not their native currency. The numbers are trustworthy.
